# Data Folder

This folder is intended to store raw datasets used in the fraud detection project.

**Note:**  
- Actual datasets are **not included** in the repository to keep the repo size manageable and protect sensitive information.  
- Place your local copies of `Fraud_Data.csv`, `creditcard.csv`, and `IpAddress_to_Country.csv` here when running the project locally.  
- This folder contains a `.gitkeep` file to keep it tracked in the Git repository.
